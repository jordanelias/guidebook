# T-113  File the four held sub-national instruments under their own codes

_One task, one pull request. Read `CLAUDE.md` first; beyond it this file is self-contained. Index, order and the owner decision register: `workplan/2026-11-12-bidirectional-pipeline/REMEDIATION-WORKPLAN.md`. Evidence base: `workplan/2026-11-12-bidirectional-pipeline/01-handshake-ledger.md`, as corrected by `scratchpad/session_2026-11-12-pipeline-bidirectional-audit/audit/fa-corrections-for-suite.md` (where they differ, the corrections govern). Every number in this file was read on 2026-11-12 and is given with the command that produces it: re-run the command; do not trust the number._

**Pilot status.** Not piloted. Three tasks of this plan were executed in scratch clones (T-006, T-008, T-010) and the defects they showed in the task files were corrected in every file by one generator; this file's own steps have not been executed by anyone. Its evidence command was run on 2026-11-12 and printed what section 3 states. Expect to find a defect in this file, and report it rather than work around it.

## 2. Preconditions

- **The integration base.** This workplan must be on the branch you start from. If the workplan's pull request is merged, that is `origin/main`. Until then it is the workplan branch, `origin/ccr-408aaa9b-z3e4s0` (if that name is gone: `git branch -r --contains "$(git log --all --format=%H -1 -- workplan/2026-11-12-bidirectional-pipeline/REMEDIATION-WORKPLAN.md)"`). Every command in this file uses `$BASE`, set by the first line of the set-up block, and never a literal `origin/main`: on a base that lacks the workplan, a diff against `origin/main` contains the whole workplan and every gate and count is about the wrong change.
- **Tasks that must be merged to the integration base first:** T-024 merged (the jurisdiction table and its verb). Check by running that task's own after-test (its section 6), or `git log "$BASE" --oneline | grep -F "<that task's commit subject>"`.
- **Owner decisions:** none outstanding. The decisions this task needed are resolved under delegation (next bullet); none is still the owner's.
- **Delegated resolutions this task rests on.** OD-01: sub-national codes with a parent, the parent a provenance relation only; whether a sub-national instrument counts toward its country's coverage is OD-04 (the owner's) and is not touched here. Each is a resolution by an Opus-class model under the owner's delegation of 2026-11-12: not the owner's words, reversible by the owner, and read only through the ledger's gate (`grep -n -F "Convention 2026-11-12 — how a delegated resolution" references/project-standards.md`). Run it before you start and again before you open the pull request; if any line prints CLOSED, stop (section 9):
```
gate(){ s=$(grep -F "$1 STATUS:" references/project-standards.md | tail -1); c=$(grep -F "$1 CHECK:" references/project-standards.md | tail -1); case "$s" in *"ANSWERED BY THE OWNER"*) echo "$1 OPEN (owner)";; *"RESOLVED UNDER DELEGATION"*) case "$c" in *"not required"*|*confirmed*) echo "$1 OPEN (delegated; ${c#*CHECK: })";; *) echo "$1 CLOSED (check: ${c:-none})";; esac;; *) echo "$1 CLOSED (${s:-no status line})";; esac; }
for n in OD-01 OD-04; do gate $n; done
```
- **Tests that must be red (or green) before you start:** the four sources are filed under their country's code. (`AT-` numbers are the acceptance tests of `scratchpad/session_2026-11-12-pipeline-bidirectional-audit/audit/hs-improvement-programme.md` §4, §7 and §9 and of `scratchpad/session_2026-11-12-pipeline-bidirectional-audit/audit/td-requirements-and-interface-spec.md`; the test this task must turn is restated in full in section 6, so you do not need to open either.)
- **Set-up.**

```
cd /home/user/guidebook
bash .claude/hooks/ensure-deps.sh && python3 -c "import pydantic, jsonschema, yaml"
git fetch origin
W=$(git log --remotes --format=%H -1 -- workplan/2026-11-12-bidirectional-pipeline); BASE=$(git branch -r --contains "$W" --format='%(refname:short)' | grep -x origin/main || git branch -r --contains "$W" --format='%(refname:short)' | head -1); echo "BASE=$BASE"
git switch -c task/t-113-file-sub-national-instruments "$BASE"
STEM=session_$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)-<slug>            # the session stem: bare in the database, with .md for emit_data_migration --session
export SCRATCH="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/guidebook-t-113" && mkdir -p "$SCRATCH" && cp data/guidebook.db "$SCRATCH/s.db" && cp data/guidebook.db "$SCRATCH/t.db"   # s.db is the batch's working copy; t.db is for probes
```
- **Shell variables do not survive from one tool call to the next in this harness.** Write the stem down once and begin every later command block by setting `BASE`, `STEM` and `SCRATCH` again to the same values.
- **Real execution:** open with `/session-open` (it sets `scratchpad/CURRENT` to the stem and creates the folder of the same name), then `/orient`. Follow `skills/run-pipeline_SKILL.md`. **Pilot or dry run** (a scratch clone): skip `/session-open`, stay on the branch you were given, do the work on the scratch copy only, and stop before the write path below.
- Work only on the scratch copy and point every call at it inline:
```
GUIDEBOOK_DB_PATH="$SCRATCH/s.db" python3 scripts/db.py <verb> ... --session "$STEM"
```
- Land the rows only by the write path, after the work is finished:
```
python3 scripts/research/emit_batch_sql.py --scratch "$SCRATCH/s.db" --out "$SCRATCH/batch.sql"
python3 scripts/emit_data_migration.py --session "$STEM.md" --summary "<what the batch is>" --input "$SCRATCH/batch.sql"
python3 scripts/migrate_db.py
python3 scripts/migrate_db.py --rebuild "$SCRATCH/rebuilt.db"      # must exit 0
```
Research batches are serial: if another research batch merged after you copied the database, `emit_batch_sql.py` refuses ("copied from a different base"). Do not force it; start again from the new base.

## 3. The problem, in the guidebook's terms

Four held instruments are filed under their country though each says it applies to less: Approved Document M vol. 2 is "for use in England" (filed `UK`), a Flemish Government decree (`BE`), the Ontario Building Code (`CA`) and a Madrid methodology (`ES`). A comparison row then says a country requires what only a province or region does.

**Evidence command** (run from the repository root, after the set-up block so that `$SCRATCH` exists; it reads the canonical database read-only or works on a copy):

```
python3 -I -c "import sqlite3;c=sqlite3.connect('file:data/guidebook.db?mode=ro',uri=True);print(c.execute(\"select ref_id, jurisdiction, substr(pub_title,1,50) from evidence_sources where ref_id in ('REF-00992','REF-00995','REF-01013','REF-01029')\").fetchall()); print(c.execute(\"select ref_id, jurisdiction, count(*) from source_value_extractions where ref_id in ('REF-00992','REF-00995','REF-01013','REF-01029') group by 1,2\").fetchall()); print(c.execute(\"select status from gaps where gap_id='GAP-077'\").fetchall())"
```

**Expected output today:** REF-00992 `UK`, REF-00995 `BE`, REF-01013 `CA`, REF-01029 `ES`, with their extraction rows under the same codes; GAP-077 open.

If the output differs, the ground has moved: stop (section 9). Ids that appear in this command are probes read on 2026-11-12; where the command derives an id by query, that is deliberate, and a test you write must do the same (section 6).

## 4. The change

Order of preference, from CLAUDE.md §8: do nothing and say why; change a rule or convention; reuse what exists; delete the cause; only then add the smallest code that closes the defect.

1. Add each sub-national code through T-024's verb, `add-jurisdiction --code C --kind sub-national --parent P --approval-ref "Correction 2026-11-12 — to the delegated resolution of OD-01, jurisdiction in a determination" --session "$STEM"`. The `--approval-ref` is that entry's full `## ` heading, which the verb requires to be found exactly once; confirm it first (`git grep -c -F "<heading>" references/project-standards.md` prints 1). Spell by ISO 3166-2 except under the project's `UK` convention (England's code takes the `UK` prefix, never `GB`). Derive each code from the source's own statement of where it applies, quoted in the pull request with its locator; type no code you cannot quote a source for.
2. Re-file `evidence_sources.jurisdiction` of the four with `amend-source --field jurisdiction` (accepted today: `jurisdiction` is in `_AMENDABLE` in `scripts/db.py`, checked by `check_jurisdiction`), and their extraction rows with `amend-extraction --field jurisdiction`, which exists only once T-024 item 4 has merged (read 2026-11-12: `_AMENDABLE_SVE_FIELDS` lacks `jurisdiction`), each with a reason quoting the source's statement. If either verb refuses the field or the sub-national code, stop: that is a writer gap, filed and fixed in its own tooling pull request (CLAUDE.md rule 10), never hand SQL.
3. Coverage is settled by the owner's answer to OD-04 (2026-11-12): a sub-national instrument counts toward its country and owes no coverage alone (`grep -n -F "sub-national: counts toward its country" references/project-standards.md`). Write no `lang_jur_map` pair for a sub-national code. Append to GAP-077 with `amend-gap --append-note` that the four were re-filed under sub-national codes; close it only if its own text asks nothing further.

**What reads what this task adds or changes:** The comparison view (T-036); render; `jurisdiction_db_vocabulary`.

**Data migration.** This task lands rows through `scripts/emit_data_migration.py`, which names the file itself; never type a migration name or number, and never edit the file it writes. The pull request contains no schema migration and no file under `scripts/` other than that one `scripts/migrations/data_*` file.

## 5. Caller sweep

A research task renames nothing and changes no code, so the sweep that applies is the one for prose that restates a fact your rows change (CLAUDE.md rule 7a). For each row id, code or value you change, search the reading surface and the governance prose, and correct a sentence your rows make false (or stop, if correcting it is not research):

```
V='<the id, code or value you changed>'
git grep -n -F -e "$V" -- governance architecture CLAUDE.md references skills ':(exclude)references/project-standards.md' ':(exclude)references/search-log'
```

Structures this task touches, for orientation: `REF-00992`, `REF-00995`, `REF-01013`, `REF-01029`, `GAP-077`. The ledger (`references/project-standards.md`), `sessions/` and committed migrations are records and are never edited.

## 6. Verification

**Red before, green after.** Before: the four sources and their extraction rows show `UK`, `BE`, `CA`, `ES`. After, on the scratch copy and then on the migrated database: each shows its sub-national code, whose parent row is the country; no other column of those rows changed (compare before and after); `jurisdiction_db_vocabulary` passes with `EXAMINED:` above 0.

**Fixtures.** Probes run on `$SCRATCH/t.db`; the batch's own rows are written on `$SCRATCH/s.db` and reach `data/guidebook.db` only through the write path of section 2.

**The gates, once each:**

```
W=$(git log --remotes --format=%H -1 -- workplan/2026-11-12-bidirectional-pipeline); BASE=$(git branch -r --contains "$W" --format='%(refname:short)' | grep -x origin/main || git branch -r --contains "$W" --format='%(refname:short)' | head -1)
python3 scripts/audit/research_batch_dod.py --session "$STEM" > "$SCRATCH/dod.txt" 2>&1; echo "rc=$?"; grep -E 'EXAMINED|BLOCKED|PASS|FAIL' "$SCRATCH/dod.txt" | tail -8   # the research gate
scripts/preflight.sh --base "$BASE" --explain > "$SCRATCH/gate.txt" 2>&1; echo "rc=$?"; grep -E '^(RESULT|PREFLIGHT|SELFTEST)|FAIL|NOTHING-IN-SCOPE' "$SCRATCH/gate.txt"
```
- **Run each once, after the migration is applied and before the commit.** `preflight.sh` runs the selftest and `run_checks.py --changed-from`; do not run `run_checks.py` separately, and never `--all`.
- **Proof that each gate examined something.** A check scoped to a session id that matches no row passes having read nothing. Confirm the stem is the one stored on your rows. The tables a batch writes carry `created_by_session` and `updated_by_session`; for each table this task writes, `python3 -I -c "import sqlite3,sys;c=sqlite3.connect('file:data/guidebook.db?mode=ro',uri=True);print(c.execute('select count(*) from '+sys.argv[2]+' where created_by_session=? or updated_by_session=?',(sys.argv[1],sys.argv[1])).fetchone())" "$STEM" <table>` must be above 0 after the migration is applied. `research_batch_dod` prints its own `EXAMINED:` lines: read them in `dod.txt`. A passing check prints no `EXAMINED:` line in `gate.txt`; any check under `NOTHING-IN-SCOPE` there has not passed. `migration_reproducibility` compares row counts only, so an UPDATE is invisible to it: also run `python3 scripts/audit/migration_reproducibility.py --deep`, which compares every row.

## 7. Commit

Commit **after** the gate of section 6 is clean.
```
git add -A . ':!transcripts' ':!*commands.jsonl'      # add the two append-only logs only at a natural break (CLAUDE.md rule 6)
git commit -m "run-pipeline: file four sub-national instruments under their own codes [$(date -u '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')]" -m "<body: what changed, the evidence commands and their output, the callers the sweep found and what was done to each>" -m "<the attribution trailers your own session instructions give: a Co-Authored-By line and a Claude-Session line>"
```
The format is `{skill-name}: {action} [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]`, timestamp last, taken from `date -u`. Do not copy trailers from this file; use the ones your session was given.

## 8. What you must NOT do

- Do not write `data/guidebook.db` directly. Rows land only by the write path of section 2.
- Do not hand-write SQL against a table a `db.py` verb can reach. A table no verb reaches is a gap to file (`db.py add-gap`), not a licence.
- Do not put tooling in this pull request: no schema migration, no new verb, no new check, no edit under `scripts/`, `schemas/`, `.github/` or `skills/` (CLAUDE.md rule 10). A writer gap found on the way is filed and left.
- Do not write a bibliographic field from memory when a payload is in hand; do not mark a source verified that was not re-retrieved; never leave `verification_status` NULL.
- Do not move, round or re-key an adjudicated figure. Do not back-translate a term. Do not delete an empty search.
- Do not author `best_practice_synthesis` or synthesis prose below the Opus floor.
- Do not decide doctrine (mission, audience, CRPD posture, population taxonomy, evidence-tier definitions, jurisdiction scope, licensing, trajectory). Stop instead.
- Do not treat any `[A-Z]-NN` code as a container, an example or a name.
- Do not run `scripts/run_checks.py --all`, `scripts/bootstrap.sh`, or `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Do not push to `main`, rebase or force-push. Do not subscribe to pull-request activity or schedule check-ins.
- Do not hand-type a count into any file or message; write the command that computes it.

## 9. Stop conditions

Stop, change nothing further, and report (what you ran, what you saw, what you expected) when any of these happens:
- a precondition in section 2 is not met, or an owner decision named there is unanswered or answered in another form;
- the evidence command in section 3 does not give today's expected output (the defect may already be fixed, or the ground has moved);
- the red test is not red before the change, or is not green after it, after one honest attempt;
- the sweep of section 5 finds a caller (as defined there) that you cannot repair without adding something section 4 does not name. A caller you can repair is repaired and listed; a mention is left;
- a check or test that was green in the before-run is red in the after-run, at any level (the test files are registered as advisory, so the gate will not stop you: the before-and-after comparison is what does);
- `sha256sum data/guidebook.db` changes when this task has no migration, or the rebuild does not reproduce the database when it has one;
- you would have to guess a value, a vocabulary term, a name or an owner's intent.
- a source's own text does not state where it applies, so its code would be guessed: leave it under its country and say so.
- any of the four rows is linked to a live determination (`select count(*) from specifications where retired_at is null` is not 0): stop, because re-filing would change a published comparison without a re-derivation.
- the delegation gate of section 2 prints CLOSED for a decision this task rests on (the owner has reversed it, a correction has withdrawn it, or its independent check is not recorded); a delegated resolution is never the owner's words;

## 10. Rollback

Before the migration is applied: delete the scratch copy; nothing has changed. After it is committed: a data migration is append-only and immutable; correct a wrong row with a compensating migration written through the same verbs (retire, supersede, amend), never by editing or deleting the file.

## 11. Adversarial pass and pull request

Real execution only; a pilot stops after section 7.
1. Run `/adversarial` once on the finished diff (a read-only critic attacks the claim, then you repair). One pass; no pass on the pass. For a research task the pass is recorded in the database with `db.py record-adversarial-pass` and closed with `close-adversarial-pass`.
2. Run `/batch-done`; it is the only definition of finished.
3. Push the branch. Open the pull request **last**, once, against the integration base (section 2). Title = the commit subject. Body: the problem; the evidence before and after; each caller the sweep found and what was done to it; each check you ran with its `EXAMINED:` line, before and after; the code-size line; what was not verified. End the body with the pull-request attribution line your session instructions give.
4. Immediately after creating the pull request call `unsubscribe_pr_activity` for it (creating a pull request subscribes the session by itself). Do not watch it, do not poll, do not schedule a reminder. Push nothing afterwards except a deliberate change; the final push is never `[skip ci]`.
5. One pull request merges at a time. If another task's pull request merged while you worked, take it with `git merge "$BASE"` after `git fetch origin` (never rebase) and, if you carry a schema migration, derive its number again by the rule in section 4.
