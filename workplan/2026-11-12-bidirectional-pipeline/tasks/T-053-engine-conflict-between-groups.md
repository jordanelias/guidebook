# T-053  Conflict between groups in the engine

> **NOT FOR SONNET** — the owner's answer to OD-19 first (reserved; CRPD posture), then a design by the Fable agent or an Opus-class session. A Sonnet-class executor that opens this file does not start it: it reports that the task is waiting, and for what.

_One task, one pull request. Read `CLAUDE.md` first; beyond it this file is self-contained. Index, order and the owner decision register: `workplan/2026-11-12-bidirectional-pipeline/REMEDIATION-WORKPLAN.md`. Evidence base: `workplan/2026-11-12-bidirectional-pipeline/01-handshake-ledger.md`, as corrected by `scratchpad/session_2026-11-12-pipeline-bidirectional-audit/audit/fa-corrections-for-suite.md` (where they differ, the corrections govern). Every number in this file was read on 2026-11-12 and is given with the command that produces it: re-run the command; do not trust the number._

**Pilot status.** Not piloted. Three tasks of this plan were executed in scratch clones (T-006, T-008, T-010) and the defects they showed in the task files were corrected in every file by one generator; this file's own steps have not been executed by anyone. Its evidence command was run on 2026-11-12 and printed what section 3 states. Expect to find a defect in this file, and report it rather than work around it.

## 1. Identity

| | |
|---|---|
| Task | T-053 |
| Title | Conflict between groups in the engine |
| Wave | 4 |
| Layer (CLAUDE.md §3) | 2 |
| Kind | **TOOLING** (CLAUDE.md rule 10: tooling and research never share a pull request) |
| Executor | NOT FOR SONNET (see the note above) |
| Traces to | IMP-32 (its engine part) in `scratchpad/session_2026-11-12-pipeline-bidirectional-audit/audit/hs-improvement-programme.md`; split from T-032 so that the relations OD-07 and OD-25 settle do not wait on OD-19 |

## 2. Preconditions

- **The integration base.** This workplan must be on the branch you start from. If the workplan's pull request is merged, that is `origin/main`. Until then it is the workplan branch, `origin/ccr-408aaa9b-z3e4s0` (if that name is gone: `git branch -r --contains "$(git log --all --format=%H -1 -- workplan/2026-11-12-bidirectional-pipeline/REMEDIATION-WORKPLAN.md)"`). Every command in this file uses `$BASE`, set by the first line of the set-up block, and never a literal `origin/main`: on a base that lacks the workplan, a diff against `origin/main` contains the whole workplan and every gate and count is about the wrong change.
- **Tasks that must be merged to the integration base first:** T-032 merged. Check by running that task's own after-test (its section 6), or `git log "$BASE" --oneline | grep -F "<that task's commit subject>"`.
- **Owner decisions that must be answered first.** The answer must be in `references/project-standards.md` (the ledger), in the owner's words.
  - **OD-19** — **answered by the owner, 2026-11-12:** "Record now; the engine applies an ordering once you approve it" (`grep -n -F "OD-19: record now" references/project-standards.md`). The recording half is built in T-032; this task is the engine half only.
  - **OD-36** — **answered by the owner, 2026-11-12 (fourth set):** "Approve that ordering, held once as data; each class warranted by a held source's own finding" (`grep -n -F "OD-36: the harm ordering" references/project-standards.md`): injury > loss of independent use > pain > effort > discomfort; a tie goes to a named judge. Check: `grep -F "OD-36 STATUS:" references/project-standards.md | tail -1` must read `ANSWERED BY THE OWNER`.
- **Tests that must be red (or green) before you start:** none until the owner answers. (`AT-` numbers are the acceptance tests of `scratchpad/session_2026-11-12-pipeline-bidirectional-audit/audit/hs-improvement-programme.md` §4, §7 and §9 and of `scratchpad/session_2026-11-12-pipeline-bidirectional-audit/audit/td-requirements-and-interface-spec.md`; the test this task must turn is restated in full in section 6, so you do not need to open either.)
- **Set-up.**

```
cd /home/user/guidebook                                    # repository root; every command below runs from here
bash .claude/hooks/ensure-deps.sh && python3 -c "import pydantic, jsonschema, yaml"   # a red check without pydantic proves nothing
git fetch origin
BASE=$(git cat-file -e origin/main:workplan/2026-11-12-bidirectional-pipeline/REMEDIATION-WORKPLAN.md 2>/dev/null && echo origin/main || echo origin/ccr-408aaa9b-z3e4s0); echo "BASE=$BASE"
git switch -c task/t-053-engine-conflict-between-groups "$BASE"                               # real execution only; never commit on main (see below for a pilot)
sha256sum data/guidebook.db                                # record it
export SCRATCH="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/guidebook-t-053" && mkdir -p "$SCRATCH" && cp data/guidebook.db "$SCRATCH/t.db"   # all experiments run on this copy
```
- **Shell variables do not survive from one tool call to the next in this harness.** Begin every later command block with the `BASE=…` line and the `export SCRATCH=…` line above (both are fixed, so repeating them is safe), and pass `GUIDEBOOK_DB_PATH` inline on each `db.py` call as shown.
- **Real execution** (the working repository, a pull request intended): run `/session-open` before the first command, so the command log lands in this task's own session folder (CLAUDE.md §7), and create the branch as shown.
- **Pilot or dry run** (a scratch clone, no pull request): do not run `/session-open`, do not touch `scratchpad/CURRENT`, stay on the branch you were given instead of `git switch -c`, and stop after section 7 (no push, no pull request, no `/batch-done`). Say in your report that it was a pilot.

## 3. The problem, in the guidebook's terms

Harm asymmetry and broadest benefit are doctrine the engine does not apply. When figures for two groups pull one parameter in opposite directions, the engine has no rule, and nothing records which rule a person applied or why.

**Evidence command** (run from the repository root, after the set-up block so that `$SCRATCH` exists; it reads the canonical database read-only or works on a copy):

```
git grep -n -i -E 'harm.?asym|broadest' -- scripts/assess | wc -l
```

**Expected output today:** `0`: the engine names neither rule.

If the output differs, the ground has moved: stop (section 9). Ids that appear in this command are probes read on 2026-11-12; where the command derives an id by query, that is deliberate, and a test you write must do the same (section 6).

## 4. The change

Order of preference, from CLAUDE.md §8: do nothing and say why; change a rule or convention; reuse what exists; delete the cause; only then add the smallest code that closes the defect.

1. **The ordering as data, held once.** A base table `harm_classes` (`class_code` primary key, `rank` integer, unique, 1 = most severe, `ledger_pointer` to the OD-36 answer), seeded by this migration with exactly the five approved rows in order: `injury`, `loss-of-independent-use`, `pain`, `effort`, `discomfort`. The engine reads the order from the table at use; no list or rank is typed in code (the owner's seventh statement). Changing the order is a migration with a new ledger pointer, never a code edit.
2. **Each side's class and its warrant, one home (rule 5).** `conflicts` gains, per side, `harm_class_a`/`harm_class_b` (foreign keys into `harm_classes`) and `harm_warrant_a`/`harm_warrant_b` (foreign keys into `source_value_extractions(extraction_id)`): the warrant is a **pointer to the held figure whose own finding states the harm** (its `harm_finding` and verified quote), never a copy of the finding and never a model's estimate. `add-conflict` (and an amend verb for an existing row) refuses a class without a warrant, a warrant row whose `harm_finding` is empty, and a warrant whose figure is not for the side's group. A class with no warrant yet is simply not set.
3. **What the engine does.** For a cell with an open conflict: if both sides carry a warranted class and the ranks differ, it sets the default to the option that protects the side with the more severe class and records a supplementary-provision flag for the other side (the 2026-03-30 harm-asymmetry steps 2 and 3), with the two warrant pointers on the result. **If either side has no class or no warrant, it refuses to apply the ordering**, reports the conflict as unweighed and names what is missing; it never infers a class. **If the ranks are equal, it records a tie** and leaves the conflict open for a named judge (`conflicts`' judge column from T-032); it decides nothing.
4. The relations, convergence, judged discussion and the recording of conflicts (OD-19, "record now") are T-032's and are not changed here.

**What reads what this task adds or changes:** The engine; `add-conflict` and its amend verb; render (the discussion of a contested cell, with both warrants); the cell-status verb (T-034: "conflict unweighed" or "tie, awaiting a judge").

**Schema migration (this task has one).** Never type a migration number. Derive it at execution time: `ls scripts/migrations | grep -E '^[0-9]{3}_' | sort | tail -1` gives the highest; yours is that plus one, zero-padded, in `scripts/migrations/NNN_<slug>.sql`, and it ends by setting `PRAGMA user_version` to the same number. Run `python3 scripts/audit/joined_cells_census.py` before and after and keep both outputs (the last line is `EXAMINED: … candidate(s)`; a new column must not add a candidate). Apply it only with `python3 scripts/migrate_db.py` (this is the one sanctioned way `data/guidebook.db` changes). Prove it with `python3 scripts/migrate_db.py --rebuild "$SCRATCH/rebuilt.db"` (exit 0) and `python3 scripts/audit/migration_reproducibility.py --deep` (PASS). SQLite cannot add a `NOT NULL` foreign key or change a CHECK in place: use create, copy, drop, rename inside the migration, and list every view and index that names the table (`select type, name from sqlite_master where sql like '%<table>%'`; they must be recreated). The pull request contains no `scripts/migrations/data_*` file.

**Code size.** Report in the pull request the output of `git diff --shortstat "$(git merge-base HEAD "$BASE")" -- scripts schemas .github skills ':!scripts/migrations'` (run it after `git add`, so new files count), and for anything added name what reads it and what existing code it replaces or makes deletable. The base is the point where your branch left `$BASE`, not `origin/main` by name.

## 5. Caller sweep

Names to sweep: `conflicts`, `add-conflict`

**What a caller is.** A hit is a *caller* when its behaviour or its truth changes with this task: code that calls or imports the name; a test that exercises the behaviour you are changing, even if it asserts nothing about it; a view, trigger or index; a registry `cmd` or `basis`; a skill, command or governance sentence that states the behaviour being changed. A hit that stays true after your change is a *mention* and needs nothing. **Fixing a caller the sweep finds is in scope** (CLAUDE.md rule 4): make the fix in this pull request and list it there.

**What the sweep leaves out, and why.** `workplan/` (plans, and the generated `workplan/pipeline-state-graph/graph.json` and `STATE-GRAPH.md`, which list every verb and are rebuilt by their builder; only `machines.yaml` there is hand-written, and it is swept); `references/project-standards.md` (the append-only ledger: a sentence there is superseded by a new entry, never edited); `scripts/migrations/` (immutable once committed); `sessions/`, `_archived/`, `audits/`, `versions/`, `dossier/`, `transcripts/`, `scratchpad/` (frozen records).

```
N='<name>'                                                 # run once per name
git grep -n -F -e "$N" -- scripts schemas .github .claude skills ':(exclude)scripts/migrations'                    # code, tests, skills, agents, commands, hooks, workflows
python3 -I -c "import sqlite3,sys;c=sqlite3.connect('file:data/guidebook.db?mode=ro',uri=True);print([(r[0],r[1]) for r in c.execute('select type,name from sqlite_master where sql like ?',('%'+sys.argv[1]+'%',))])" "$N"   # views, triggers, indexes
python3 -c "import yaml,sys;print([c['id'] for c in yaml.safe_load(open('governance/check-registry.yaml'))['checks'] if sys.argv[1] in str(c)])" "$N"   # the check registry
git grep -n -F -e "$N" -- governance architecture CLAUDE.md references workplan/pipeline-state-graph/machines.yaml ':(exclude)references/project-standards.md' ':(exclude)references/search-log'   # prose and hand-written needles
```
If this task adds, renames or removes a verb, a table, a view or the text of a refusal, also run `python3 workplan/pipeline-state-graph/build_graph.py --check` (it writes nothing) and report its result. An object that returns 0 rows is unproven, not clean.

**Hits when this file was written** (2026-11-12, the two `git grep` lines above with `-l`; re-run them, a new file in your output is a hit to judge):

- `conflicts`: many hits; re-run the commands, and judge each against the owner's answer. Known code: `scripts/db.py`, `scripts/dbcore.py`, `scripts/audit/pipeline_contract_audit.py`, `scripts/audit/graph_audit.py`, `skills/cross-population-conflict-mapper_SKILL.md`, `skills/run-pipeline_SKILL.md`.
- `add-conflict`: re-run the command.

Every test file in that list is run before and after the change (section 6): a test that calls what you change is a caller even when it asserts nothing about it.

## 6. Verification

**Step 1, before any edit: the before-run.** These registered checks read what this task touches: `test_assess_cell_pilot`, `test_db_integrity`, `test_run_pipeline_refusals`, `migration_reproducibility`, `schema_reference_audit`. Run each as the registry runs it and keep the output. The command reads each check's `cmd` from the registry, so a renamed script is still found:

```
CHECKS="test_assess_cell_pilot test_db_integrity test_run_pipeline_refusals migration_reproducibility schema_reference_audit"
for c in $CHECKS; do cmd=$(python3 -c "import yaml,sys,shlex;print(shlex.join(next(x['cmd'] for x in yaml.safe_load(open('governance/check-registry.yaml'))['checks'] if x['id']==sys.argv[1])))" $c); $cmd > "$SCRATCH/before-$c.txt" 2>&1; echo "$c rc=$? | $(grep -E 'EXAMINED|RESULTS|FAILED|VERDICT' "$SCRATCH/before-$c.txt" | tr '\n' ' ' | cut -c1-200)"; done
```

Each line shows the check's subject (`EXAMINED:`). A check that is red here was red before you touched anything (on 2026-11-12 `test_scan_contract` failed two cases, G01 and G02, and `retired_vocabulary` reported occurrences): record it and carry on. A check that prints no `EXAMINED:` line, or `EXAMINED: 0`, examined nothing: say so in the pull request.

**Step 2: red before, green after.** Before: the evidence command prints `0` and `select count(*) from sqlite_master where name='harm_classes'` prints 0. After, on a scratch copy with conflicts seeded by the test (never typed into the canonical database): (a) `select class_code, rank from harm_classes order by rank` gives the five approved rows in order; (b) injury (warranted) against effort (warranted) sets the default for the injury side and flags a supplementary provision for the other; (c) the reverse seeding gives the reverse default (a test for each direction); (d) equal classes record a tie and leave the conflict open; (e) a side with a class but no warrant, or a warrant whose `harm_finding` is empty, makes the engine refuse to apply and report what is missing; (f) `add-conflict` refuses a class without a warrant. Each red on the unchanged code.

**Writing the test.** Take case ids that cannot collide: prefix them with this task's number (`T053-01`, `T053-02`, …) and confirm the prefix is free first (`grep -c '"T053-' <the test file>` prints 0). Never type into a test an id, a code or a count the database can derive: choose every probe by query (for example the first term of a domain that is not yet a parameter, is not declined in `parameter_declinations` with `revoked_at IS NULL`, and whose name carries no digit). A probe for "the legitimate case still works" must be one that no *other* refusal stops, or it fails for the wrong reason. Where the live data offers no such row, build it on the test's own scratch copy or print the file's `SKIPPED-NO-FIXTURE` line, as the file's existing cases do. A new test must be able to fail: show it red on the unchanged code, or on a seeded defect that you then remove.

**Fixtures.** Anything a test or probe writes goes to a copy, is labelled `TASK-FIXTURE`, and never reaches `data/guidebook.db`.

**Step 3, after the change: the after-run.** The same loop with `after-` in place of `before-`. Then compare, check by check: `diff <(grep -E '\[✗\]|^ *FAIL|^FAILED|VERDICT: FAIL' "$SCRATCH/before-$c.txt") <(grep -E '\[✗\]|^ *FAIL|^FAILED|VERDICT: FAIL' "$SCRATCH/after-$c.txt")`. No failing case may appear that was not failing before; the `EXAMINED:` number may only change by the cases you added.

**Step 4: the gate, once.**

```
BASE=$(git cat-file -e origin/main:workplan/2026-11-12-bidirectional-pipeline/REMEDIATION-WORKPLAN.md 2>/dev/null && echo origin/main || echo origin/ccr-408aaa9b-z3e4s0)
scripts/preflight.sh --base "$BASE" --explain > "$SCRATCH/gate.txt" 2>&1; echo "rc=$?"; grep -E '^(RESULT|PREFLIGHT|SELFTEST)|FAIL|NOTHING-IN-SCOPE' "$SCRATCH/gate.txt"
```
- **Run it once, when every edit is made, before the commit.** It compares your working tree (committed or not, untracked files included) with the point where your branch left `$BASE`, so it does not need a commit first. `preflight.sh` runs the registry selftest and then `run_checks.py --changed-from`: do not run `run_checks.py` separately on the same diff, and never `--all`. Re-run it only if you change a file afterwards.
- **A passing check prints no `EXAMINED:` line in this output.** The subject of each check is read in the per-check runs above (`$SCRATCH/after-<check>.txt`), not here. In `gate.txt` read three things: the `RESULT` line; any check under `NOTHING-IN-SCOPE` (it has not passed: say so); any blocking `FAIL`.
- **A check that was already red before your change** (the before-run shows it) tells you nothing about your diff: name it in the pull request with its before and after lines, and move on.

## 7. Commit

Commit **after** the gate of section 6 is clean.
```
git add -A . ':!transcripts' ':!*commands.jsonl'      # add the two append-only logs only at a natural break (CLAUDE.md rule 6)
git commit -m "governance: handle conflict between groups as the owner answered [$(date -u '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')]" -m "<body: what changed, the evidence commands and their output, the callers the sweep found and what was done to each>" -m "<the attribution trailers your own session instructions give: a Co-Authored-By line and a Claude-Session line>"
```
The format is `{skill-name}: {action} [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]`, timestamp last, taken from `date -u`. Do not copy trailers from this file; use the ones your session was given.

## 8. What you must NOT do

- Do not write `data/guidebook.db` directly, with SQL, Python or any tool. Only `scripts/migrate_db.py` changes it.
- Do not run `scripts/run_checks.py --all`, `scripts/bootstrap.sh`, or `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Do not decide doctrine: mission, audience, CRPD posture, population taxonomy, evidence-tier definitions, jurisdiction scope, licensing, trajectory. If the task seems to need such a decision, stop.
- Do not author `best_practice_synthesis` or any synthesis prose. A Sonnet-class model is below that floor.
- Do not treat any `[A-Z]-NN` code (old item codes met in `references/`, `working/`) as a container, an example or a name.
- Do not put research rows (`scripts/migrations/data_*`, new evidence, extractions, determinations) in a tooling pull request, or tooling in a research one (CLAUDE.md rule 10).
- Do not push to `main`, rebase, or force-push. Do not subscribe to pull-request activity or schedule check-ins.
- Do not hand-type a count into any file or message; write the command that computes it. Do not type into a test an id, a code or a count the database can derive.
- Do not add a table, column, check, verb or script that section 4 does not name. If one seems needed, stop and report. **This does not forbid fixing a caller:** a test fixture, a comment, a skill sentence or a help string that the sweep of section 5 shows is made false or red by your change is in scope, is fixed in this pull request, and is listed there.
- Do not weaken a refusal, relax a CHECK, quarantine a check or change a registry level to make something pass.

## 9. Stop conditions

Stop, change nothing further, and report (what you ran, what you saw, what you expected) when any of these happens:
- a precondition in section 2 is not met, or an owner decision named there is unanswered or answered in another form;
- the evidence command in section 3 does not give today's expected output (the defect may already be fixed, or the ground has moved);
- the red test is not red before the change, or is not green after it, after one honest attempt;
- the sweep of section 5 finds a caller (as defined there) that you cannot repair without adding something section 4 does not name. A caller you can repair is repaired and listed; a mention is left;
- a check or test that was green in the before-run is red in the after-run, at any level (the test files are registered as advisory, so the gate will not stop you: the before-and-after comparison is what does);
- `sha256sum data/guidebook.db` changes when this task has no migration, or the rebuild does not reproduce the database when it has one;
- you would have to guess a value, a vocabulary term, a name or an owner's intent.
- the owner's answer is absent or in another form, or it would need a rule this file does not quote.

## 10. Rollback

Before merge: close the pull request and delete the branch; nothing else has changed. After merge: `git revert <merge commit>` in a new pull request. A migration that has been committed is never edited or deleted: fix forward with a compensating migration (CLAUDE.md rule 3). Never rewrite history.

## 11. Adversarial pass and pull request

Real execution only; a pilot stops after section 7.
1. Run `/adversarial` once on the finished diff (a read-only critic attacks the claim, then you repair). One pass; no pass on the pass. For a research task the pass is recorded in the database with `db.py record-adversarial-pass` and closed with `close-adversarial-pass`.
2. Run `/batch-done`; it is the only definition of finished.
3. Push the branch. Open the pull request **last**, once, against the integration base (section 2). Title = the commit subject. Body: the problem; the evidence before and after; each caller the sweep found and what was done to it; each check you ran with its `EXAMINED:` line, before and after; the code-size line; what was not verified. End the body with the pull-request attribution line your session instructions give.
4. Immediately after creating the pull request call `unsubscribe_pr_activity` for it (creating a pull request subscribes the session by itself). Do not watch it, do not poll, do not schedule a reminder. Push nothing afterwards except a deliberate change; the final push is never `[skip ci]`.
5. One pull request merges at a time. If another task's pull request merged while you worked, take it with `git merge "$BASE"` after `git fetch origin` (never rebase) and, if you carry a schema migration, derive its number again by the rule in section 4.
