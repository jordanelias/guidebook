-- SCHEMA migration -- v_scan_ledger re-ranked and its obstacle classification given one home, after the third
-- adversarial review of the run-pipeline repair, 2026-11-06 (scratchpad run-pipeline-round3-adjudication.md,
-- R3-1 ledger half and R3-8). No table, column or row changes.
--
-- Migration 122 ranked BLOCKED above every reading; 123 ranked it below every reading. Both were guesses. This order is
-- the one derived from what each fact proves: a FULL reading proves the obstacle gone (the whole text was read), so it
-- outranks a block; a partial, fragment or abstract reading does not prove the full text obtainable, so under a
-- standing obstacle the pair is BLOCKED, not reading debt -- and the row still names that reading in scan_id /
-- text_scope / method (the LEFT JOIN is unchanged), so "abstract read, full text paywalled" shows as both facts.
-- Nothing clears processing_blocked_reason any more (record-scan stops writing evidence_sources in the db.py unit of
-- the same repair): the column is the retrieval record and stays as history.
-- Readers: scan_debt.py, research_batch_dod R16-scan and R11-harvest, verified_scan_integrity.py, `db.py record-scan`
-- and `db.py add-source` help.

DROP VIEW v_scan_ledger;

CREATE VIEW v_scan_ledger AS
-- v_scan_ledger: one row per (source in scope) x (active parameter).
--
--   source in scope   evidence_sources with superseded_by_ref_id IS NULL. A tombstone is
--                     never read again; its replacement is.
--   active parameter  base_parameters.status = 'active'. Retired and merged parameters
--                     leave the ledger (their extractions stay, as history).
--
-- STATUS PRECEDENCE, first match wins:
--   1 EXTRACTED          a non-absent extraction exists for the pair (any figure_role).
--   2 STATED-ABSENT      only claim_type 'absent' extractions exist: the source addresses
--                        the quantity and sets nothing -- a positive statement.
--   3 READ-NOTHING-FOUND a FULL-scope reading covers the pair and found no row.
--   4 BLOCKED            no full reading covers the pair AND the source carries an obstacle
--                        processing_blocked_reason (below): the full text could not be
--                        obtained or read, so the pair is not reading debt until a full
--                        reading is recorded. Any partial / fragment / abstract reading of
--                        the pair is still named in scan_id / text_scope / method.
--   5 READ-PARTIAL       only partial / fragment / abstract readings cover it, and no
--                        obstacle stands: the full text is obtainable and unread -- debt.
--   6 NOT-READ           no reading covers it.
-- WHY THIS ORDER (it is derived from what each fact proves; 122 ranked BLOCKED above every
-- reading and 123 below every reading, both guesses): a FULL reading proves the obstacle
-- gone, since the whole text was read, so 3 outranks 4. A partial, fragment or abstract
-- reading proves nothing about the full text, so under a standing obstacle 4 outranks 5.
-- A reading COVERS a pair when it is catalogue-mode with catalogue_version >= parameter_id
-- (the parameter existed when the reading was made), or targeted at that parameter. Rows 1
-- and 2 win over readings because a row written is stronger evidence than a reading
-- recorded; 3 wins over the rest because a full reading supersedes a partial one.
--
-- THE BLOCKED CASE BELOW IS THE ONE HOME of "the text could not be obtained or read", and
-- this header is the ONE HOME of the classification of every processing_blocked_reason
-- value (evidence_sources CHECK, migration 091); each value appears here as a bare token
-- under exactly one head, and a test derives the CHECK and fails on a value this header
-- does not name. The writers and gates read this view's status, never the column. NOTHING
-- CLEARS THE COLUMN: it is the retrieval record and stays as history; the ledger alone says
-- whether a pair is still blocked.
--   obstacle to the text (BLOCKED, above):  no-full-text, paywalled, language.
--   copy of a typed fact (not an obstacle; the writers refuse it by pointer -- the judgement
--     lives in db.py _BLOCK_REASON_COPIES): no-quantified-claims -> a recorded full reading;
--     superseded -> superseded_by_ref_id.
--   pending owner question 8 of the round-3 adjudication, treated as NULL (the source owes
--     its reading): out-of-scope, tier-not-required (they say no text was unobtainable);
--     no-doi, not-indexed (migration 091's comments describe discovery -- "no resolvable
--     identifier for automated paths", "absent from the indexes the pipeline queries" --
--     not an obstacle to a text in hand, and a URL-only report admitted without a DOI can
--     be read).
--
-- scan_id / text_scope / method name the STRONGEST covering reading (full scope first,
-- then full-read before pre-screen, then the latest), so a READ-NOTHING-FOUND resting on
-- a pre-screen only is visible as such. NULL when no reading covers the pair.
